## Introduction

The Maze Pathfinding Visualization project is designed to illustrate the workings of various pathfinding algorithms in a maze environment. Users can interactively place obstacles, set start and goal positions, and visualize the search algorithms as they find the path through the maze.

## Features

- Interactive maze creation with obstacles.
- Visualize DFS, BFS, and A* pathfinding algorithms.
- Clear button to reset the maze.
- Adjustable algorithm delay for better visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pygame**: Library for creating the graphical interface and visualizations.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-pathfinding-visualization.git
   cd maze-pathfinding-visualization
2. **Install Pygame:**
      ```bash
      cd phase1
## Usage
### Running the Maze Builder
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
    cd phase1
2. **Run the MazeGUI script:**
   ```bash
   python MazeGUI.py
## Interacting with the Maze Builder
- Left-click to place/remove obstacles.
- 1st Right-click to set the start and 2nd Right-click to set the goal positions.
- DFS Button to start Depth-First Search visualization.
- BFS Button to start Breadth-First Search visualization.
- A Button* to start A* Search visualization.
- Clear Button to reset the maze.
